You can place a piece, when it is your go, such that between this newly placed piece, is at least one opponents piece, and one of your pieces on the other side of the opponents piece.

This will then capture your opponents piece, turning it to your colour. 

The game ends when there is no more legal moves to play or the board is full.

The winner is the player with more of their pieces on the board.

Scores are displayed once the game is finished.
